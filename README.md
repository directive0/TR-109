This repository hosts a set of design documents for the TR-109 Mark I Picorder. A Picorder is a Raspberry Pi based handheld device that records and displays sensor data for immediate analysis. The TR-109 is designed to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a set of custom designed PCBs, and a 3D printed enclosure to achieve this goal. This project, along with [PicorderOS](https://squaredwave.com/wiki/index.php?title=PicorderOS) attempts to be a single self contained solution for anyone wishing to produce their own Picorder.

## What is included:

- The enclosure_design folder contains the .blend file used to produce the STLs for the case, diffusers and spacers. It also contains the main STLs ready to be printed, and an svg file to produce your own stickers.

- The pcb_design folder contains KiCad 5.1.7 files of both the mainboard and the sensorboard pcbs. These files can be used to produce and test PCBs.


## What is not yet included:

- There are no assembly instructions. I hope to produce some in the future.



While it is not required, if you make a picorder using this repository I would appreciate you sharing photos or videos your build with me at chris@squaredwave.com.
